# Ghibli Image Generator

A **quick and fun 10-minute minor project** to create simple, Ghibli-inspired images using AI! 🚀

---

## ✨ About the Project

This is a lightweight project that takes text prompts and generates simple Ghibli-style images using Google's **Gemini API** and **Pillow** for image handling.  
Perfect for experimenting with AI art generation when you have just a few minutes to spare!

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pillow** (`pip install Pillow`)
- **Google Gemini API access** (with valid API Key)
- **`google-generativeai`** Python library (`pip install google-generativeai`)

### API Setup:
- You will need an **API Key** for **Google Gemini**.
- Follow the instructions [here](https://ai.google.dev/) to get your key.
- Set your API key securely in your environment variables or load it into your script (Replace my API key, if your using the forked repo).

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Quality**: Images might not be highly detailed or hyper-realistic.
- **Accuracy**: Since it's a quick-generation model, some images may not perfectly match very complex or specific human figures.
- **Time Constraints**: As it is designed for speed, it may sacrifice some image fidelity.
